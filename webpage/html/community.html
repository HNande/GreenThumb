                  <h3>Pizza party</h3>
                  One of the best ways to celebrate reeaching the reward threshold is a big pizza party.
                  Using our own freshly grown tomatoes to create the tomato sauce, milking our very
                  own cows to obtain the cheese, and farming our own wheat to grind the flour, Green Bob
                  makes a pizza nobody could possibly resist. Every bite fills the members with more passion
                  to keep working hard on their green tasks, making this reward is a great motivator.

                  Green Bob is a well connected man, and one time, he was able to secure a visit by the former
                  American President, Barack Obama. Mr. Obama was very impressed with our community and our
                  goals, and he congratulated our members for completeing the reward threshold. He was
                  particularly charmed by our avocado trees, and our members were happy to offer him an avocado
                  toast straight from the tree. The members enjoyed singing songs and playing board games with
                  Mr. Obama, and this was a very exciting and proud day for Cloverville.

                  <h3>Planting trees in Cloverville</h3>
                  Trees are amazing! Here in Cloverville, we love trees so much, we decided to plant a bunch of
                  them in our garden. Green bob was able to find great mango, apple, and pear trees for the
                  members to plant. Quite a few of us are vegan, so more fruit options are a great addition
                  to the community. In all, we were able to plant roughly 60 to 70 trees of many varieties.
                  This was a great reward for the members, who worked dilligently to earn the community points.
